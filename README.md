## Who am I
<!--
a question we should all ask ourselves. #note plural ref#states -->

In, or around, 2011;
 I was in a conversation regarding the current state of the world; and,
  the U.S. Political Affairs.
Post this discussion,
 upon our 'good-buys;'
I was asked if
 I 'believe in' the things I spoke about, generally.
Being this:
 a naturally progressive engagement;
  dialogue had flowed with no prior decisions on stances or positions.
I responded that I did,
 in fact, hold to my heart the perspectives on the topics in light.
With this clarity<!--,'s--> in revelation,
 for the other participant(s);
  a quesiton was then posed,
   as an agreement; and,
    a slight challenge to the roots of the [idealogy](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/ideology.html) presented.
"*This Asshole*"<!--(terms of endearment)-->
 would vote for me when
  my name appears on their ballot;
   I am to run for President,
    regardless the concept that I would '*win*;'
     instead, premised, on the notion that 'people' *need* to *hear me speak*.
     I am not permitted to know which state they are from or a few other caveats.
     Upon the notion of duty being inlaid to country
      a primary component and
       a nudging reminder of this;
        we shook on the terms
         in front of witnesses.
