# If we all Sounded like Niko

If we all sounded like Niko when we talked;
then, I do not believe that we would need any <!--'centralized' opposed to self governing 'nodes'-->government at all.

<!-- what is lost in the transcription-->

The fact is that we pick individuals who reflect our own [];
and, at eighth grade reading levels and "5<sup>th</sup> Grade" understandings;
it is amazing we got Obama <!--the ...-->while we have so many "Bushisms" and "Trumpisms".

It's not that great orators haven't been established; maybe, this is due to their ability to [communicate](__ "Reagan, the Great Communicator") and deliver [Oration](__ "Eisenhower - Farewell") with [Impact](__ "Orwell Comes to America").

The, compound, Question is:
> Does picking "Someone 'liked' most by the general population; lead to *A More Perfect Union*?

When A::B is wrong and further that B::A doubly so.

When diversity is one of our best attributes; how is there so much copycatting of policy?
Nebraska and Maine; the *closest* one's to participating properly.

What if the goal of the people is to *chuse* the best individuals who select from the population; no parties.

### War Parties

Tearing our country apart.
The party chest grows and
those without,
are left without voice
to a loudspeaker, pushed.

### Investment periods

$1.2 Billion businessman; buying the polls.
Competing with emotional 'momentum'/priorKnowledge/attachment of opposition/audience(s).

Presidency pays $300,000/yr (right?)

> $1,200,000,000 / ($300,0000/yrs) = 4,000/yrs

### Randomness and Attention

Novelty (seeking) + Mongolia

## Protection

From ourselves.
