# Food Contract Termination 

## FEMA is paying to feed people

Food is being delivered from central locations to individuals and groups around the city. Restauranteurs (food trucks) are contracted on a daily rotation every week.

### Some contractor(s) were taking advantage of this

One day a contractor may have provided a full meal; including: vegetables, carbs, and meat... seasoned and pulled pork in decent rations.

The payment from FEMA to a contractor is assusemed to be per plate.

One contractor was 'skimping' on providing nutrition; and, in defense would say things like "if they're hungry enough, they'll eat it."

This food is going to a wide array of individuals; some who're quarantined at home.

## The Protagonist

Deliah, was supported in pushing forward to inform the, correct, city personell of the contractors failures to provide nutrition.

### Gabriel & D'Artagnan

Deliah gets support in pushing forward when there was doubt about whether the action should be pursued.

### The Officials

Provide false and innacurate information; dissuading Deliah from continuing to inform the contract provider of the inadequacies.

## Deliah Succeeds

Deliah's pursuits lead to ensuring contact with the correct representatives and making a case for nutritional meals.
