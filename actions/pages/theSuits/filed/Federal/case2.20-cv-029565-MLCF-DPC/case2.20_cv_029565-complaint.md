# "Whatever the merits"

## Judge ORDERS DISMISSAL without taking the merits

## Judge omits large swaths of original complaint

- ### Making sure to only address it from the frame of perspective desired to be dismissive

- #### This fails liberal construction

- "Intended to be Amended & Addended"

## Judge states not in position to offer "Opinion"

- ### 'cite opinions'
