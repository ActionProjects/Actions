<!-- Responding to this order is a waste of time for someone who isn't giving attention anyhow. The appearance of judicial diligence, through the copy pasting of some rulings, most likely from a legal understudy, is largely a display of ignorance of the issue; and, highlights the failure to check the link posted for reference. The Judges OPINIONS slip through the wording used; making clear a posture. -->

it's more important you able to interpret me; than I you.
the duty upon the court is to establish communicative grounds via translations and comprehension of the truths before it.

the blatant omissions from the Order show a true disregard for the premise of a court in the first place.

The strictly one sided; narrowly scoped view, is in defense of ignorance; rather than begging the questions before it.
