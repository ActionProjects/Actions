Judge doesn't understand the assertion & dismisses anyhow.

"have combined" how is that interpreted; these entities follow some similar rule? Did I say 'homeless'? (i hope not)

Maybe, Rules from FinCEN & the Patriot Act - anti-Money Laundering?

> [prompt sua sponte](https://github.com/ActionProjects/Actions/blame/main/actions/pages/theSuits/filed/Federal/case2.20-cv-029565-MLCF-DPC/order.md#L61 "In law, sua sponte or suo motu describes an act of authority taken without formal prompting from another party. The term is usually applied to actions by a judge taken without a prior motion or request from the parties. The form nostra sponte is sometimes used by the court itself, when the action is taken by a multi-member court, such as an appellate court, rather than by a single judge. While usually applied to actions of a court, the term may reasonably be applied to actions by government agencies and individuals acting in official capacity. One situation in which a party might encourage a judge to move sua sponte occurs when that party is preserving a special appearance, and therefore cannot make motions on its own behalf without making a general appearance. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sua_sponte")

Failed; maybe instead of looking to attack the argument, as a Judge, should be looking to interpret the issue. your latin majik words failed you.

<!-- Responding to this order is a waste of time for someone who isn't giving attention anyhow. The appearance of judicial diligence, through the copy pasting of some rulings, most likely from a legal understudy, is largely a display of ignorance of the issue; and, highlights the failure to check the link posted for reference.

please cite where it allots states jurisdiction over presidential qualifications  
-> it allots a measured number of electoral candidates and their restrictions.  
Constitutional Addendums 12th, 20th, 25th provide no jurisdiction to the states for eligibility.

Electoral College Candidates are the only requirement one may need to ensure are fulfilled. The issues being 'addressed' are "Residence" and Voting Access; along with a littany of other access to services including failed delivery of IRS Stimulus.

it's more important you able to interpret me; than I you.

the duty upon the court is to establish communicative grounds via translations and comprehension of the truths before it.

the blatant omissions from the Order show a true disregard for the premise of a court in the first place.

The strictly one sided; narrowly scoped view, is in defense of ignorance; rather than seeking the questions before it.

B. Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?

This is an effective limitation. Like all state laws, those regulating voting for presidential electors cannot impose discriminations which deny equal protection of the laws.
