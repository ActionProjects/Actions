### QUESTION PRESENTED

This case involves an extraordinary attempt by an unelected state board of
elections to rewrite the unambiguous terms of a statute enacted in June by a
bipartisan state legislature to set time, place, and manner requirements for absentee
voting in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of enforcing the General
Assembly’s carefully considered requirements, the state board entered a settlement
with advocacy groups that, just days before the general election, rewrites the election
code to achieve its own preferred policy goals. This administrative rewrite of the
election code usurps the authority delegated to the General Assembly under the
United States Constitution, undermines the equal protection rights of voters, and is
already causing the voter confusion and chaos that this Court warned about in
_Purcell v. Gonzalez_ , 549 U.S. 1 (2006). The question presented is:
Is an emergency injunction warranted to stop a state board of elections from
usurping the constitutional authority of the state legislature by unlawfully changing
the requirements of a state election code on the eve of an election?

To the Honorable John G. Roberts, Jr., Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and Circuit Justice for the Fourth Circuit:
```
Predicting “further intolerable chaos” absent an injunction against the North
Carolina State Board of Election’s unlawful rewrite of North Carolina’s election code,
Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson “urge[d] plaintiffs to take this case up to the Supreme
Court immediately.” App. 023 (Wilkinson, J. and Agee, J., dissenting). Applicants
heed that call. Pursuant to Supreme Court Rules 20, 22, and 23, and 28 U.S.C. §
1651, Applicants (“Plaintiffs”) respectfully request an immediate, emergency writ of
injunction to prevent the North Carolina State Board of Elections (the “Board”), an
executive agency, from unlawfully changing North Carolina’s statutory election code
weeks after voting began and only days before election day. More specifically,
Plaintiffs seek an injunction that prohibits the Board from implementing or enforcing
several Numbered Memos that rewrite the election code by extending the state’s
absentee ballot receipt deadline, undermining the postmark requirement, and
weakening provisions prohibiting ballot harvesting which were enacted by the North
Carolina General Assembly. Plaintiffs also ask the Court to consider this Application
as a petition for certiorari, grant certiorari on the questions presented, treat the
Application papers as merits briefing, and issue a merits decision as soon as
practicable.

### **INTRODUCTION**

In June 2020, an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the North Carolina
General Assembly exercised the authority granted to that body by Article I, § 4 of the
United States Constitution and enacted the Bipartisan Elections Act of 2020

(“HB1169”) to address the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
upcoming general federal election. HB 1169 achieves a delicate balance of objectives
by easing restrictions on absentee voting, while maintaining long-established
requirements necessary to protect the integrity of the election process. Two weeks
into the voting period, after 150,000 absentee ballots had already been submitted, the
Board, unsatisfied with the balance struck by HB1169, began issuing a series of
Numbered Memos that effectively rewrote much of North Carolina’s election code.
These Memos far exceed the Board’s authority, have upended the delicate balance
struck by the legislature, and have sown chaos in North Carolina’s federal elections.
Under HB 1169 and other statutes adopted by the General Assembly, North
Carolina voters must obtain the signature of a witness when submitting an absentee
ballot (the “Witness Requirement”), ensure that the ballot is postmarked and received
within three days after election day (the “Receipt Deadline”), and adhere to other
requirements (for instance, restrictions on the handling of absentee ballots).
Several advocacy groups challenged these statutory requirements in state and
federal court. Those initial challenges were almost entirely rejected as meritless by
the courts.
Notwithstanding these initial successes defending the legislation, the Board
cut a secret deal with the advocacy groups in an attempt to rewrite the statutory
requirements by executive fiat.[<sup>1</sup>](^1) On September 22, weeks after voting began on

signed off on this agreement, both Raymond and Black resigned from the board in protest shortly afterwards, voicing concerns that they had been gulled into providing their assent by other state

___

September 4 and after 150,000 absentee ballots were already submitted, the Board
issued a series of Numbered Memos that purport to eliminate the Witness
Requirement, extend the Receipt Deadline by 6 days, redefine the postmark
requirement, and rework other provisions of North Carolina’s election code designed
to protect the integrity of the federal election. The Board seeks nothing less than to
usurp the constitutional authority of the General Assembly by imposing a new
statutory scheme in the middle of an election, thereby subjecting North Carolina
voters to arbitrary and disparate standards for the receipt and handling of ballots.
The Board attempted to justify these changes in part by relying on a federal court
order issued on August 4, 2020, but that order actually upheld the Act as a proper
exercise of the General Assembly’s constitutional authority. That court swiftly
admonished the Board for misrepresenting and mischaracterizing its order to gain a
state court’s approval of the Numbered Memos.
The Board’s actions offend the Constitution and pose an immediate threat to
the integrity of the federal election process. By rewriting the statute and redefining
the requirements for submitting a lawful absentee ballot, the Board violates core
separation-of-powers principles, intrudes on the power of the state legislature under
the United States Constitution, and offends the guarantee of equal protection. To
protect the federal interests at stake and restore the status quo established by the

officials without understanding “all the implications of the settlement.” Gary D. Robertson, _GOP

).

---

General Assembly, Plaintiffs urge the Court to prohibit the Board from implementing
the Numbered Memos and enjoin it from further interfering with this election.
When a member of the originally-assigned panel at the Fourth Circuit realized
that the panel intended to grant Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, the
panel dissenter broke with the traditional process and hastily arranged an en banc
vote to remove the case from the assigned panel. _See_ App. 048-49 (Niemeyer, J.,
dissenting). The en banc Fourth Circuit then refused to issue an injunction,
downplayed the seriousness of the Board’s constitutional violations, relied on its own
policy judgments about which restrictions on absentee voting are appropriate, and
then concluded that the current pandemic justified the Board’s statutory rewrite.
And it did all of this while blithely asserting that the serious constitutional concerns
raised by the Board’s statutory rewrite were “beyond [its] understanding.” App. 012.
But as this Court has recognized, federal courts must guard against “illegitimate and
unconstitutional practices” and “deviations from legal modes of procedure” before
they are able to “get their first footing,” because even “[s]light encroachments create
new boundaries from which legions of power can seek new territory to capture.” _Stern
v. Marshall_ , 564 U.S. 462, 503, (2011) (Roberts, C.J.) (quotation marks omitted).
This is not the first time the Fourth Circuit has failed to protect this federal
election based on a misunderstanding of applicable law. This Court recently
recognized the importance of adhering to “legal modes of procedure” when the Fourth
Circuit failed to do so. In _Andino v. Middleton_ , No. 20A55, 592 U.S. ___, 2020 WL
5887393 (Oct. 5, 2020), the district court altered South Carolina’s election code, a

three-judge Fourth Circuit panel granted a stay, but the en banc Fourth Circuit
vacated the stay so as to allow the changes in the election code to take effect. This
Court disagreed with the en banc Fourth Circuit and issued a stay protecting South
Carolina’s election code from last-minute change.^2
This case presents the same indisputably clear case for relief: The district
court failed to protect North Carolina’s election code, a three-judge panel was
prepared to grant an injunction pending appeal, _see_ App. 048-49 (Niemeyer, J.,
dissenting), but again the en banc majority stepped in to deny relief, substituting its
own policy preferences for those of the North Carolina General Assembly. Plaintiffs
urge this Court to grant an emergency injunction to protect the state election code,
remedy an egregious violation of separation of powers principles and the
unambiguous text of the United States Constitution’s Elections and Electors clauses,
and stop an ongoing violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.
**JURISDICTION**
On October 3, 2020, the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of North Carolina granted a temporary restraining order, App. 141, holding that
Plaintiffs’ claims under the Equal Protection Clause were meritorious. In the same
order, the court transferred the case to the Middle District of North Carolina. On
October 6, Plaintiffs filed a motion to convert the temporary restraining order into a
preliminary injunction. On October 14, the United States District Court for the

Middle District of North Carolina held that Plaintiffs had standing and were likely
to succeed on two of their Equal Protection challenges. Nonetheless, the court denied
injunctive relief, App. 140, based solely on its understanding of this Court’s decision
in _Purcell v. Gonzalez_ , 549 U.S. 1 (2006). The following day, Plaintiffs filed their
notice of appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), and an emergency motion for an
injunction pending appeal in the Fourth Circuit. Over the dissents of Judges
Wilkinson, Agee, and Niemeyer, the en banc Fourth Circuit denied that request for
injunctive relief on October 20. App. 001. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.
§ 1254(1) and 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a).

### FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

**A. The Consent Judgment and Numbered Memos**
In June 2020, exercising the authority granted by Article I, § 4 of the United
States Constitution, the North Carolina General Assembly enacted bipartisan
legislation (“HB1169”) to clarify the time, place, and manner requirements for voting
in the upcoming general federal election and to address challenges posed by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Passed by a vote of 105-14 in the North Carolina House of
Representatives and by a vote of 37-12 in the North Carolina Senate, the General
Assembly enacted HB 1169 after weighing competing proposals and input from the
Board. _See_ House Bill 1169 Voting Record, North Carolina General Assembly,
available at https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookup/2019/H1169 (accessed October 20,
2020). Governor Cooper signed the bill and it became law.
Despite the legislature’s bipartisan revision of the state’s election code to
account for the COVID-19 pandemic, certain advocacy groups and individuals filed
lawsuits seeking to change the statutory requirements, urging courts to adopt policies
that the bipartisan General Assembly had rejected. For three months, the Board
defended HB 1169 against these lawsuits, prevailing in all material respects in a
federal court case ( _Democracy North Carolina_ ) and a state court case before a three-
judge panel ( _Chambers_ ). _See Democracy N.C._ , 2020 WL 4484063, at *64; Order on
Mot. for Prelim. Inj.; _Chambers v. North Carolina_ , No. 20 CVS 500124 (Sup. Ct. Wake
Cty., N.C.) (“ _Chambers_ Order”). Both courts—at the Board’s urging—denied relief in
part because of the imminence of the November 3 election. _See Democracy N.C._ , 2020
WL 4484063, at *130-31; _Chambers_ Order, at 7.

On September 22—two weeks after absentee voting had already started, and
with approximately 150,000 absentee ballots cast—the Board announced a secretly
negotiated “Consent Judgment” with certain advocacy groups and individual
plaintiffs. Neither the Plaintiff nor the authorized representatives of the General
Assembly consented to this settlement. Six weeks after the federal district court had
already found that it was too late to make sweeping changes to North Carolina’s
election laws, the Board undertook to do just that through a series of “Numbered
Memos” issued pursuant to the Consent Judgment. The Numbered Memos rewrite
several statutory requirements:

- Revised Numbered Memo 2020-19 effectively eliminated the statutory requirement that another person witness an absentee ballot (the “Witness
    Requirement”) by allowing a voter tocertification through the submission of a cure affidavit cure the omission of a witness _executed by the voter_ ,
    but without fulfilling the Witness Requirement. _See_ App. 164; _see also_
    N.C.G.S. § 163-231(a).^3
- Numbered Memo 2020-22 **triples** the statutory deadline for ballots to be
    received, from three days to ni(nine days) _with_ N.C.G.S. § 163-231(b)(2)(b) (three dane (the “Receipt Deadline”). ys). The Memo also guts _Compare_ App. 172
    the statutory requirement that a ballot be postmarked on or before election day by changing the definition of “postmark” from its understood meaning as “[a]n

(^3) The Board defended this action in state court by^ relying on an order issued by Judge Osteen in
the ballots without providing notice of any def _Democracy North Carolina_ case in which he enjoined thiciencies and an opportunity to cure. e Board from rejecting absentee _See Democracy
N.C. v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections_ 2020). But when the Revised Numbered Memo, No. 1:20CV457, 2020 WL 6058048, at 2020-19 was brought to his attention, Judge *3 (M.D.N.C. Oct. 14,
Osteen found that the Board had seriously mischaracterized his ruling in _Carolina_. _See id._ at *7 (“The [Board’s] mischaracterization of this court’s injunction in order to _Democracy North_

On October 2, Judge G. Bryan Collins of the Wake County Superior Court
approved the Consent Judgment to which the contested Memos are appended. In
those proceedings, the Board repeatedly represented that the Memos were motivated,
and even required, by the federal court’s previous ruling in _Democracy North
Carolina_. _See Democracy N.C. v. N.C. State Bd. of Elections_ , No. 1:20CV457, 2020
WL 6058048, at *3 (M.D.N.C. Oct. 14, 2020) (stating that the Board “cited this court’s
August Order” from Democracy North Carolina in “arguing that the North Carolina
Superior Court should approve and enter the Consent Judgment”). But as the federal
court recognized, the Board “grossly mischaracterize[ed]” that ruling. _See Democracy
N.C._ , 2020 WL 6058048, at *9; _see also id. at_ *7 (“The [Board’s] mischaracterization
of this court’s injunction in order to obtain contradictory relief in another court
frustrates and circumvents this court’s August Order.”).
**B. Plaintiffs’ Federal Action**
On September 26— _before_ the state court judge considered the proposed
Consent Judgment—Plaintiffs filed this case and sought a temporary restraining
order against the Numbered Memos in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of North Carolina. _See_ Compl., _Wise_ App. 181; Mtn. for Temporary
Restraining Order, App. 215; _see also Moore v. Circosta_ , No. 20-cv-507-D, Compl.,

App. 252 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 26, 2020) (raising similar challenges). On October 2—
immediately following the hearing before Judge Collins regarding the Consent
Judgment—United States District Judge James C. Dever III held a hearing. The
next morning, Judge Dever granted the TRO. App. 159.
By October 3, voters had requested 1,157,606 absentee ballots and returned
340,795 of them under the requirements established by the General Assembly. The
TRO was “intended to maintain the status quo”— _i.e._ , the statutory requirements
enacted by the General Assembly. On October 4, the Board issued another Numbered
Memo placing the challenged Memos on hold based on the TRO. _See_ App. 179,
Numbered Memo 2020-28 (placing on hold Numbered Memos 2020-19, 2020-22, 2020-
23, and 2020-27). The Board’s October 4 Memo instructed county boards to “take no
action” with respect to deficient absentee-ballot return envelopes. _Id._
Judge Dever then transferred both cases ( _Wise_ and _Moore_ ) to Judge Osteen
(M.D.N.C.), who is also handling the _Democracy North Carolina_ case, for further
proceedings. _Id_. Plaintiffs in the _Wise_ and _Moore_ cases moved for preliminary
injunctions, and Judge Osteen heard those motions on October 8.
On October 14, Judge Osteen issued a 91-page order. _See_ App. 050. In that
order, the district court held that Plaintiffs had “established a likelihood of success
on their Equal Protection challenges with respect to the [Board’s] procedures for
curing ballots without a witness signature and for the deadline extension for receipt
of ballots.” App. 052. The court expressed its view that “the unequal treatment of

voters and the resulting Equal Protection violations as found herein should be
enjoined.” _Id_.
Based on its reading of this Court’s decision in _Purcell,_ 549 U.S. at 1, however,
the district court denied the injunction, “ _even in the face of what appear to be clear
violations_ ” of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. App. 139_._ The district court concluded
that _Purcell_ required it to refrain from issuing an injunction so close to an election.
Upon expiration of the TRO on October 16, and lifting on October 19 of a later
temporary stay issued by the North Carolina Court of Appeals, the Board first
officially began instructing local elections officials to implement the Memos, on
October 19, 2020.^4
Plaintiffs immediately sought emergency injunctive relief from the Fourth
Circuit. Five days later, on October 20, the Fourth Circuit, sitting _en banc_ , denied
the injunction, holding that the Numbered Memos do not violate equal protection and
_Purcell_ weighs against an injunction. Judges Wilkinson, Agee, and Niemeyer
dissented. The dissenting judges lamented the “proliferation of pre-election
litigation” that is “plagu[ing]” our country and “creat[ing] confusion and turmoil...
that threatens to undermine public confidence in the federal courts, state agencies,
and the elections themselves.” App. 021-22 (Wilkinson, J. and Agee, J., dissenting).
The dissenting judges believed that _Purcell_ required an injunction to prevent the
“pernicious pattern” of courts changing election rules at the last minute and to protect

(^4) _See_ https://www.ncsbe.gov/about-e^ lections/legal-resources/numbered-memos (last accessed

the North Carolina legislature’s responsibility in U.S. Const. art. 1, § 4, cl. 1, to set
the time, place, and manner of federal elections. _Id._ at App. 046.
**ARGUMENT**
A Circuit Justice may issue an injunction when there is a “significant
possibility” that the Court would take the case on appeal and reverse, and where
“there is a likelihood that irreparable injury will result if relief is not granted.” _Am.
Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. v. Gray_ , 483 U.S. 1306, 1308 (1987) (Blackmun, J., in chambers).
Because the issuance of an injunction grants judicial intervention that has been
withheld by lower courts, the legal rights at issue must be “indisputably clear.”
_Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC_ , 507 U.S. 1301, 1301 (1993) (Rehnquist, C.J., in
chambers) (citation omitted).
This Court has granted emergency injunctions pending appeal, including in at
least three cases involving elections. _See Lucas v. Townsend_ , 486 U.S. 1301 (1988)
(enjoining bond referendum election where parties claimed that change in election
date required Attorney General’s approval); _McCarthy v. Briscoe_ , 429 U.S. 1317
(1976) (granting injunction ordering candidate’s name to appear on general election
ballot in Texas as independent candidate for President); _Williams v. Rhodes_ , 89 S. Ct.
1 (1968) (granting temporary injunctive order to compel state authorities to place
names of Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates at next election on ballot
pending decision on merits).
An injunction in this case is essential to protect the integrity of the federal
election. The standards for injunctive relief are satisfied. If this Court does not
intervene, the unilateral conduct of the unelected Board will not only deprive Plaintiff

voters of their right to equal protection, but will also make “the promise of the
Constitution’s Elections and Electors Clauses into a farce.” App. 046 (Wilkinson, J.
and Agee, J., dissenting). Granting emergency relief is necessary to avoid “making
the courts appear partisan, destabilizing federal elections, and undermining the
power of the people to choose representatives to set election rules.” _Id_.
**I. Plaintiffs Have Demonstrated a Clear Entitlement to Injunctive Relief
Because the Legal Rights at Issue Are Indisputably Clear.**
The Board’s unilateral and unlawful revision of North Carolina’s election code
is intolerable, especially after the General Assembly enacted specific election rules
for absentee ballots in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board’s attempt
to rewrite the rules enacted by the people’s elected representatives through a back-
door settlement reached in the wake of failed litigation contravenes basic separation-
of-powers principles, violates Plaintiffs’ equal protection rights, and guarantees
significant voter and administrative confusion. This Court’s intervention is urgently
needed to restore the status quo and to ensure that the rules enacted by the North
Carolina General Assembly are properly enforced. Failure to do so will incentivize
other rogue actions by election administrators and partisan groups in the future.
**A. The Board’s Actions Offend Separation of Powers Principles,
Violate the Elections Clause, Electors Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause, and Guarantee Election Chaos.**
It is indisputably clear that the federal Constitution grants the North Carolina
General Assembly exclusive authority to establish the time, place, and manner of
federal elections within North Carolina. It is also indisputably clear that the
unelected Board has no authority—and certainly no authority on the eve of a federal

election after votes have already been submitted—to impose arbitrary changes in the
rules that the General Assembly has enacted. If permitted to stand, the Board’s
unlawful actions will deprive North Carolina citizens of the right to be treated equally
in how their votes are counted, and will undermine the integrity of the federal
election.
In declining to grant injunctive relief, the Fourth Circuit saw no problem in
allowing the Board to second guess the judgment of the General Assembly by
rewriting HB 1169, including undermining the postmark requirement and changing
the ballot receipt deadline from 3 to 9 days. According to the Board, whether ballots
are “illegally counted if they are received more than three days after Election Day
depends on an issue of state law from which we must abstain.” App. 013. That is
clearly wrong.
The Constitution vests exclusive authority in the State legislature to establish
the rules for federal elections within the state. _See_ U.S. Const. art. 1, § 4, cl. 1 (“[T]he
Times, Places, and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,
shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature therefore”); U.S. Const. art. II,
§ 1, cl. 2 (“Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may
direct,” electors for President and Vice President). Because that authority is a power
that is “strictly and exclusively legislative,” as a matter of federal constitutional law
it cannot be transferred to executive branch officials. _Gundy v. United States_ , 588
U.S. __, 139 S. Ct. 2116, 2127 (2019) (quoting _Wayman v. Southard_ , 23 U.S. (10
Wheat) 1, 42–43 (1825)); _see also Cook v. Gralike_ , 531 U.S. 510, 523 (2001) (state “may

regulate the incidents of [congressional] elections ... only within the exclusive
delegation of power under the Elections Clause”); _McPherson v. Blacker_ , 146 U.S. 1,
27 (1892) (explaining that the Electors Clause “leaves it to the legislature exclusively
to define the method” of appointing presidential electors) (emphasis added). As the
dissent rightly recognized, “[t]he word ‘legislature’ was ‘not of uncertain meaning
when incorporated into the Constitution.’” App. 035 (Wilkinson, J. and Agee, J.,
dissenting) (quoting _Smiley v. Holm_ , 285 U.S. 355, 365 (1932)); _see also Hawke v.
Smith_ , 253 U.S. 221, 227 (1920)).^5
This should have been the end of the matter. As the Fourth Circuit dissent
explains, nothing in North Carolina law attempts to delegate that authority to the
Board. The election code repeatedly circumscribes the Board’s role to issuing rules
that do _not_ conflict with statutes enacted by the General Assembly. _See_ N.C. Gen.
Stat. § 163-22(a) (providing that the Board’s rules cannot “conflict with any provisions
... of” North Carolina’s election code); _see also id._ § 163-22.2 (providing that any
emergency rules promulgated by the Board cannot “conflict with any provisions of..
.Chapter 163 of the General Statutes”). The General Assembly did not intend to grant
the unelected Board such a pivotal role in our federal election. _See Utility Air
Regulatory Grp. v. EPA_ , 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (noting that a legislature is expected
to speak clearly when it delegates power to make “decisions of vast economic and
political significance”); _see also FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp_ ., 529 U.S.

5
Federalist No. 59 (Alexander Hamilton) (describing This case law is consistent with the original public meaning of those clauses. how power over federal elections is neither _See, e.g._ , The
“wholly in the national legislature, [n]or wholly in the latter and ultimately in the former” but referring to no other part of government). in the State legislatures” but rather “primarily

120 (2000). There is no argument that the Board wields general legislative power
such that it has the “‘power that makes laws’” in North Carolina. _Ariz. State
Legislature v. Ariz. Indep. Redistricting Comm’n_ , 576 U.S. 787, 814 (2015) (quoting 2
A Dictionary of the English Language (1st ed. 1755)).
Indeed, the Board’s “emergency powers” are limited to “conduct[ing] an
election in a district where the normal schedule is disrupted by” a “natural disaster,”
“extremely inclement weather,” or “an armed conflict.” N.C. Gen. Stat. § 163-27.1.
Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic does not fit within this narrow authority
because the pandemic has not disrupted the “normal schedule”—the election will be
held as scheduled on November 3. Moreover, the North Carolina General Assembly,
acting in bipartisan fashion, enacted HB 1169 directly in response to the COVID-19
pandemic just a few months ago. The Board cannot now, on the eve of the election,
invoke that _same pandemic_ as an “emergency” to rewrite the unambiguous statute
and upset the balance struck by the General Assembly.
This Court’s precedent is clear that, under no circumstances may an executive
branch agency “rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute
should operate.” _Utility Air Regulatory Grp._ , 573 U.S. at 328 (holding that federal
agency lacks authority to rewrite “unambiguous numerical thresholds”); _see also id._
at 326 (“An agency has no power to ‘tailor’ legislation to bureaucratic policy goals by
rewriting unambiguous statutory terms”). “It is hard to imagine a statutory term
less ambiguous than the precise numerical” requirement that ballots be received
within three days to be lawfully counted. _Id._ Neither the Board, nor the Fourth

Circuit majority, has any authority “to rewrite clear statutes under the banner of
[their] own policy concerns.” _Azar v. Allina Health Servs._ , 587 U.S. __, 139 S. Ct. 184,
1815 (2018). And changing the numerical statutory requirement for receiving
absentee ballots from 3 to 9 days is precisely the type of arbitrary numerical selection
that requires legislative judgment. _Cf. Hoctor v. United States Dep’t of Agric._ , 82 F.3d
165, 171 (7th Cir. 1996) (explaining why public notice-and-comment rulemaking is
required when an agency makes numerical choices, even when exercising delegated
authority).
Because the election code is clear and unambiguous, there is no basis for a
federal court to abstain from preventing these alarming rule-of-law violations. _See
Wisconsin v. Constantineau_ , 400 U.S. 433, (1971) (abstention rules apply only “where
‘the issue of state law is uncertain’”) (quoting _Harman v. Forssenius_ , 380 U.S. 528,
534 (1965)); _see also Stenberg v. Carhart_ , 530 U.S. 914, 945 (2000) (same). As the
Fourth Circuit dissent correctly recognizes, a “significant departure from [a State’s]
legislative scheme for appointing presidential electors” or for electing members of the
federal Congress “presents a federal constitutional question” that federal courts must
answer. _Bush v. Gore_ , 531 U.S. 98, 113 (2000) (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring). That is
because a state legislature’s authority to set voting rules in federal elections is
granted by the federal Constitution; it is not a residual authority that the states
retained when they joined the union. As a result, “in the context of a Presidential
election, state-imposed restrictions implicate a uniquely important national interest.”
_Anderson v. Celebrezze_ , 460 U.S. 780, 794–95 (1983); App. 037 (Wilkinson, J. and

Agee, J., dissenting) (explaining that authority of state legislatures to set time, place,
and manner of elections is a federal constitutional power that cannot be usurped by
other branches of state government).
As a matter of federal law, federal courts have a plain obligation to intervene
in defense of state election statutes. _See Bush_ , 531 U.S. at 112–14 (Rehnquist, C.J.,
concurring) (explaining this point). That is particularly true because the separation-
of-powers violations here resulted from the Board’s gamesmanship: after successfully
defending North Carolina’s election code in federal and state court, the Board
improperly used a federal court order to justify issuance of the Numbered Memos as
part of a state court settlement, and now seeks to prevent the federal judiciary from
intervening to stop this lawlessness.
An injunction is also necessary to prevent a clear equal protection violation.
Substituting its own policy preferences for those of the General Assembly, the Fourth
Circuit majority contends that rewriting the statute, including changing the receipt
requirement from 3 to 9 days, makes it easier for more people to vote, and asserts
that “no one was hurt by the deadline extension.” App. 012. But that line of reasoning
cannot be reconciled with the basic separation-of-powers principles discussed above.
As this Court has emphasized, “[d]eciding what competing values will or will not be
sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative
choice.” _Rodriguez v. United States_ , 480 U.S. 522, 526 (1987) (per curiam).
The Fourth Circuit’s reasoning is also wrongheaded. Through the majority’s
narrow lens, changing the voting requirements merely “removes burdens on other

citizens exercising their right to vote.” App. 019-20 (Motz, J., concurring); _see also_
App. 012 (finding no equal protection violation in part because “no voter [would] be
treated differently than any other voter”). But the majority’s equal protection
analysis ignores how the Board’s statutory rewrite treats voters differently in an
arbitrary and disparate fashion. The Numbered Memos (in their relevant forms),
which were first issued on September 22, 2020 are not retroactive, and became
effective on October 19. On their face, they do not apply to the 594,727 voters cast
their ballots prior to Monday, October 19.^6 _See_ https://www.ncsbe.gov/ (providing
updated totals). The Numbered Memos treat these otherwise similarly situated
594,727 voters differently than all subsequent voters in North Carolina.
As this Court has recognized, “[h]aving once granted the right to vote on equal
terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one
person’s vote over that of another,” because such unlawful action can also deny
suffrage “by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as
effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.” _Bush_ , 531 U.S.,
at 104–05.^ The North Carolina Supreme Court has similarly recognized that
counting ballots cast in contravention of North Carolina’s election code “effectively
disenfranchises those voters who cast legal ballots.” _James v. Bartlett_ , 359 N.C. 260,
270, 607 S.E.2d 638, 644 (2005) (quotation marks omitted). The majority cannot
ignore this principle simply by assuming that ballots cast pursuant to the Board’s

unilateral change are in fact lawful, _see_ App. 012, since that is precisely what is in
dispute.
Two federal judges recognized that the Board’s issuance of the Numbered
Memos changes state law in violation of the right to equal protection. Judge Dever
of the Eastern District of North Carolina recognized that the Board’s actions “raise
profound questions concerning arbitrariness and vote dilution.” App. 154. As Judge
Dever found, over 150,000 North Carolina voters (including Plaintiff Wise) had cast
absentee ballots under the General Assembly’s statutory scheme as of September 22
when the Board announced the Numbered Memos, and that number increased to
319,209 absentee ballots by the time the state court approved the Numbered Memos
on October 2. _Id._ The Memos “materially changed the rules under which the election
was taking place” by eliminating the Witness Requirement, extending the Receipt
Deadline, and undermining the Assistance Ban. _Id._ at App. 154-55. Judge Dever
explained that by issuing Numbered Memos 2020-19, 2020-22, and 2020-23, the
Board “ _ignored the statutory scheme_ and arbitrarily created multiple, disparate
regimes under which North Carolina voters cast absentee ballots,” thereby violating
the Constitution. _Id._ at App. 155 (emphasis added).
Judge Osteen of the Middle District of North Carolina similarly held that
Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection challenges “to the State Board of Elections’ procedures
for curing ballots without a witness signature and for the deadline extension for
receipt of ballots” were likely to be successful on their merits. App. 052. Specifically,
he emphasized that “[a] change in election rules that results in disparate treatment

shifts from constitutional to unconstitutional when these rules are also arbitrary.”
_Id_. at App. 099. With respect to this case, Judge Osteen found that the Board
“engages in arbitrary behavior when it acts in ways that contravene the fixed rules
or procedures the _state legislature has established_ for voting and that fundamentally
alter the definition of a validly voted ballot, creating ‘preferred class[es] of voters,’”
_id._ at App. 101 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added). He ruled that the Board
had acted in just this way by changing the voting provisions related to the Witness
Requirement and the Receipt Deadline, _id._ at App. 102-08. He accordingly found that
those violations warranted injunctive relief (though he declined to issue it, as
discussed below).
The equal protection violation is clear, and is even more egregious when
considered in light of the Board’s flagrant disregard for the constitutional province of
the state legislature. This type of “clear constitutional infirmity” warrants injunctive
relief. _McCarthy v. Briscoe_ , 429 U.S. 1317, 1321 (1976) (Powell, J., in chambers)
(granting application for injunction in election case involving placement of
candidate’s name on ballot).
**B.** **_Purcell_** **Intervention Under These Circumstances. Does Not Prohibit Injunctive Relief and Supports**
This Court’s intervention is especially warranted because the lower court’s
failure to grant relief turned on a misinterpretation of this Court’s precedent. The
district court recognized the need for injunctive relief and would have granted it but
for its understanding of _Purcell_. _See_ App. 139. The district court interpreted _Purcell_
as implicating only federal court intervention, _see id._ at App. 116, and the Fourth

Circuit agreed, _see_ App. 009. That misunderstands this Court’s precedent. _Purcell_
does not bar injunctive relief here and actually encourages it.
Under the district court’s reasoning, the only bar to injunctive relief was
_Purcell_ , meaning that if _Purcell_ does not apply then an injunction should have issued.
_See_ App. 139 (“[U]nder _Purcell_ and recent Supreme Court orders relating to _Purcell_ ,
this court is of the opinion that it is required to find that injunctive relief should be
denied at this late date, even in the face of what appear to be clear violations.”). The
Fourth Circuit then ruled that _Purcell_ does not cover “action by state courts and state
executive agencies acting pursuant to a legislative delegation of authority.” App. 010.
It reached that conclusion based on its misreading of _Andino v. Middleton_ , No. 20A55,
592 U.S. ___, 2020 WL 5887393 (Oct. 5, 2020). According to the Fourth Circuit,
_Andino_ stands for the proposition that _Purcell_ applies only to federal courts. _See_ App.

1.   If that were so, however, the Fourth Circuit’s ruling that _Purcell_ does not apply
to actions by state agencies should have led it to conclude that the district court
abused its discretion when it failed to issue a preliminary injunction against the
Numbered Memos. Put differently, if the district court would have issued an
injunction absent _Purcell_ (and it said that was the case), then the Fourth Circuit’s
finding that _Purcell_ does _not_ apply should have led it to reverse the district court and
issue an injunction.
    If _Purcell does_ apply in this context, then an injunction is also required. With
less than two weeks until the election, we are within the “sensitive timeframe” under
_Purcell_. _See_ 549 U.S. at 3 (applying principle where court of appeals granted

injunction on October 5, with election on November 7). Inside this timeframe, _Purcell_
instructs that federal courts should “weigh, in addition to the harms attendant upon
issuance or nonissuance of an injunction, considerations specific to election cases and
its own institutional procedures,” taking into account how “[c]ourt orders affecting
elections, especially conflicting orders, can... result in voter confusion.” 549 U.S. at
4–5. One of the considerations specific to elections cases, as the dissent recognized,
is that the U.S. Constitution “granted state legislatures a new power they did not
possess before ratification: the power to set the rules for federal elections.” App. 037.
Indeed, “States may regulate the incidents of such elections, including balloting, only
within the exclusive delegation of power under the Elections Clause.” _Gralike_ , 531
U.S. at 523. Accordingly, under _Purcell_ , federal courts must protect voters from
confusion by preserving the status quo of statutes duly enacted by the state
legislature..
The facts of _Purcell_ and the recent _Andino_ case support this understanding. In
_Purcell_ , the Supreme Court overruled the court of appeals’ injunction of Arizona’s
voter identification statute in the weeks before the election, allowing the election to
proceed under the state’s duly-enacted statutes. 549 U.S. at 2. Similarly, in the
recent _Andino_ case, this Court protected South Carolina’s statutory witness
requirement by staying a district court injunction that prohibited the state from
enforcing that requirement in the upcoming election. _Andino_ , 2020 WL 5887393.
Justice Kavanaugh emphasized the importance of protecting requirements _adopted
by the legislature_ , stating in a concurrence that a “ _[s]tate legislature’s_ decision either

to keep or make changes to election rules to address COVID-19 ordinarily should not
be subject to” judicial second-guessing.^7 _Id._ at *2 (quotation marks omitted).
This case presents the same concerns that animated _Purcell_ , but in more
extreme form: the Board implemented significant new election rules several weeks
after voting began and only weeks before Election Day; there is a high risk of voter
confusion in light of these changes; and administrators will also be confused and
subject to additional work in terms of learning the new procedures and processing
ballots. The record supports this position. Tripling the extension of the receipt
deadline from three days after Election Day to nine days, and undermining the
postmark requirement, in addition to blatantly undermining statutes duly enacted
by the General Assembly to prevent ballot harvesting, risks giving procrastinating
voters another excuse to wait, and perhaps miss the postmark deadline, or even
mislead voters if it turns out that the extension is overturned on appeal before
Election Day. The election code sets the county canvass date at November 13, N.C.
Gen. Stat. Ann. § 163-182.5, meaning the extension of the ballot receipt deadline to
November 12 risks imposing significant administrative difficulties on county boards
already struggling with a many-fold increase in absentee ballots. The new

_v. Okeson_ Recent decisions from the courts of appeals, No. 20-2605, 2020 WL 5905325, at *1 (7th provide further support for this reading. Cir. Oct. 6, 2020) (relying on _PurcellSee_ to affirm^ _Tully_

requirement that the county boards seek evidence that ballots without a clear
postmark may have been sent by election day imposes additional burden. The Board’s
actions also flout a three-judge state court’s finding on September 3 (one day before
voting began) that the equities did not support a change to state election laws due to
the proximity of the election, the tremendous costs that an injunction would impose
on the State, and the confusion such a decision would create for voters. _See Chambers
v. North Carolina_ , Case No. 20-CVS-500124, Order (Sup. Ct. Wake Cnty. Sept. 3,
2020). All of this is a recipe for the “chaos” that, as the majority concedes, App. 011
n.6, _Purcell_ is supposed to prevent. The General Assembly, not the Board or even the
Fourth Circuit, is the appropriate body to make these delicate judgments.
If a three-judge state court found on September 3 that it was too late to change
North Carolina’s statutory election scheme, then it was too late for the Board to do so
on October 2, and certainly too late for the Board to do so on October 19 (when the
North Carolina Court of Appeals lifted its stay). The majority tries to avoid this
obvious conclusion through _ipse dixit_ : “The state court issued an order approving the
Consent Judgment on October 2. This October 2 order established the relevant status
quo for Purcell purposes.” App. 006. But the Fourth Circuit cites no support for that
assertion, which is factually inaccurate: the Numbered Memos did not become
effective until the North Carolina Court of Appeals lifted its temporary stay on
October 19.
The Fourth Circuit also fails to account for Judge Dever’s correct finding that
the status quo for this case is North Carolina’s duly-enacted statutory code, not the

Board’s unilateral changes. _See, e.g._ , App. 155 (“The [Board] inequitably and
materially upset the electoral status quo in the middle of an election by issuing the
memoranda and giving the memoranda legal effect via the October 2, 2020 consent
judgment.”). Contrary to the Fourth Circuit’s suggestion, _Andino_ supports this
position because that case focused on avoiding changes to state _legislative_
enactments. _See Andino_ , 2020 WL 5887393, at *2 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring),
(referring to the “ _[s]tate legislature’s_ decision either to keep or make changes to
election rules” in response to the COVID-19 pandemic) (emphasis added). _Andino_
confirms that the status quo is what the state legislature enacts, not what the state
executive imposes.
The upshot of all this is clear: if the Fourth Circuit is taken at its word that
_Purcell_ does not apply, then it should have issued an injunction. And if _Purcell_ does
in fact allow federal courts to enjoin the unconstitutional actions of state executive
actors, then there is no case which more clearly qualifies for injunctive relief under
_Purcell_. Either way, an injunction should issue.
**II. Plaintiffs Satisfy the Remaining Requirements For Injunctive Relief.**
Under 28 U.S.C. § 1651, an injunction is appropriate if it is “necessary or
appropriate in aid of” the Court’s jurisdiction. _See Turner Broad. Sys., Inc._ , 507 U.S.
at 1301. This Court has “consistently applied [§ 1651] flexibly and in conformity
with” the principle that “a federal court may avail itself of all auxiliary writs as aids
in the performance of its duties, when the use of such historic aids is calculated in its
sound judgment to achieve the ends of justice entrusted to it.” _United States v. New
York Tel. Co._ , 434 U.S. 159, 172–73 (1977) (quotation marks omitted).

For the reasons explained above, only an emergency injunction can stop the
Board’s rule-of-law violations, protect Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, and prevent
electoral chaos. The unique history of this case—including the Board’s initial defense
of North Carolina’s election code, its about-face when negotiating a settlement with
advocacy groups, and then its blatant disregard for state law and equal protection
through its issuance of the Numbered Memos—compels an injunction. _See Little
Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged, Denver, Colo. v. Sebelius_ , 571 U.S. 1171 (2014)
(issuing injunction “based on all the circumstances of the case”). No other legal
remedy will suffice at this late stage. _See Clinton v. Goldsmith_ , 526 U.S. 529, 537
(1999) (“The All Writs Act invests a court with a power essentially equitable and, as
such, not generally available to provide alternatives to other, adequate remedies at
law.”). An injunction is also necessary to protect this Court’s power to ensure that it
is able to grant full relief necessary to protect Plaintiffs and the integrity of the
federal election. _Cf. New York Tel. Co._ , 434 U.S. at 172 (“This Court has repeatedly
recognized the power of a federal court to issue such commands under the All Writs
Act as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the frustration of
orders it has previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction otherwise obtained.”).
Plaintiffs have also shown that “there is a likelihood that irreparable injury
will result if relief is not granted.” _Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc._ , 483 U.S. at 1308. “Any
time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by
representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.” _Maryland v.
King_ , 567 U.S. 1301 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers). The violation of Plaintiffs’

equal protection rights is also a form of irreparable injury. _See CBS, Inc. v. Davis_ ,
510 U.S. 1315 (1994) (Brennan, J., in chambers) (granting stay where irreparable
harm would have resulted from First Amendment violation). Plaintiffs would also
suffer irreparable harm because Election Day is only days away and they will likely
lose any prospect of meaningful relief should the Board continue to implement its
Numbered Memos. _See Williams_ , 89 S. Ct. at 2 (1968) (Stewart, J., in chambers)
(granting injunction in election case where failing to do so would lead to “difficult if
not insurmountable practical problems” in terms of the ability to grant later relief).
Finally, there is no risk of harm to the public because the public interest strongly
favors safeguarding “public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.”
_Crawford v. Marion Cty Election Bd._ , 553 U.S. 181, 197 (2008). Changing the voting
landscape now would create uncertainty and confusion among voters. In contrast,
granting the requested relief ensures that the election laws enacted by the North
Carolina General Assembly are carried out appropriately.
**III. There Are No Valid Reasons To Deny Injunctive Relief.**
The Fourth Circuit cited several additional reasons to deny relief in this case,
but as the dissenting judges recognized, none have merit. Nothing prevents this
Court from granting the requested relief.
**_First_** , with respect to standing, Plaintiff Wise has standing to bring an Equal
Protection Clause challenge because she cast an absentee ballot before the Board
changed the absentee voting rule regarding the receipt deadline. North Carolina law
recognizes that counting invalid ballots constitutes a harm to those who have cast
valid ballots. _James_ , 359 N.C. at 270. She has therefore alleged the concrete and

particularized injury of being arbitrarily and disparately subject to a different set of
procedures than prospective voters who would vote in compliance with the challenged
Board provision. _See Bush_ , 531 U.S. at 104–05; _see also_ App. 033 (Wilkinson, J. and
Agee, J., dissenting) (stating that the plaintiffs have standing because the Board’s
procedural changes “arbitrarily and disparately treats them differently from other
voters”). “The fact that an injury may be suffered by a large number of people does
not of itself make that injury a nonjusticiable generalized grievance.” _Spokeo, Inc. v.
Robins_ , 578 U.S. __, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1548 n.7 (2016); _see also Fed. Election Comm'n
v. Akins_ , 524 U.S. 11, 24 (1998) (“Often the fact that an interest is abstract and the
fact that it is widely shared go hand in hand. But their association is not invariable,
and where a harm is concrete, though widely shared, the Court has found ‘injury in
fact.’... This conclusion seems particularly obvious where (to use a hypothetical
example)... _large numbers of voters suffer interference with voting rights conferred
by law_ .”) emphasis added).
**_Second_** , Plaintiffs are not collaterally estopped from raising their claims in
federal court. As this Court explained in _Arizona v. California_ , 530 U.S. 392, 414
(2000), “consent judgments ordinarily support claim preclusion but not issue
preclusion.” (citation omitted). Accordingly, any overlapping issues between the state
and federal actions do not prohibit Plaintiffs from challenging the Numbered Memos
on federal grounds. Moreover, Plaintiffs in this case were not parties to the Consent
Judgment—indeed a subset of the current Plaintiffs opposed the Consent
Judgment—and do not have a relationship with the prior plaintiffs sufficient to

establish privity. _See State ex rel. Tucker v. Frinzi_ , 344 N.C. 411, 416, 474 S.E.2d
127, 130 (N.C. 1996).
**_Third_** , abstention “rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts have
a ‘virtually unflagging obligation ... to exercise the jurisdiction given them.’”
_Ankenbrandt v. Richards_ , 504 U.S. 689, 705 (1992) (quoting _Colo. River Water
Conservation Dist. v. United States_ , 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976)). _Pullman_ abstention
does not apply because the Board’s authority to issue the Numbered Memos raises
federal questions that cannot be answered by state law (or, at the least, present no
unsettled issues of state law). In addition, Plaintiffs’ challenge to the ballot-receipt
extension, postmark revision, and loosening of ballot harvesting restrictions
implicates the United States Constitution, and does not involve a “sensitive area of
social policy upon which the federal courts ought not to enter.” _Moore v. Sims_ , 442
U.S. 415, 428 (1979).
**CONCLUSION**
For these reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enjoin the
Board from implementing its Numbered Memos and enter any other relief it deems
proper.
