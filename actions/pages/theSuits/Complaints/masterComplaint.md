### Access to LAW (legel opinions, ruling, filings, etc...)

## Injunction

I Nicholas D'Artagnan Dumas demand an injunction on the 2020 Federal Presidential Election; predicated upon unfair practices by Federal and State Agencies.

## Residence

- ANIMUS MANENDI. The intention of remaining

>      RESIDENCE. The place of one's domicil. (q.v.) There is a difference between a man's residence and his domicil. He may have his domicil in Philadelphia, and still he may have a residence in New York; for although a man can have but one domicil, he may have several residences. A residence is generally transient in its nature, it becomes a domicil when it is taken up animo manendi. Roberts; Ecc. R. 75.
>     2. Residence is prima facie evidence of national character, but this may at all times be explained. When it is for a special purpose and transient in its nature, it does not destroy the national character.
*~ West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2. S.v. "residence." Retrieved November 2 2020 from [https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Residence](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Residence)*

### - FinCEN (Banner Bank, Mechanics Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America)

- bank account (checking, savings, CD, Safety Deposit Box)

### - USPS (PostNet, UPS)

- private mail delivery ref:CAEDcase

### - DMV

- form{??}ref:CAEDcase

- ### IRS

  - webform
    - inability to input 4

- ### EDD

  - webform application

- ### Blood Bank
