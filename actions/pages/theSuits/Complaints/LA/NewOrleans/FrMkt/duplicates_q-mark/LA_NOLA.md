# Complaint

There are two national disasters...
CDC has placed an eviction moratorium.
Discriminatory enforcement & hostile removal from living quarters & freight.

Conspiratorial collusion between the French Market operators & "parking enforcement" along with ('retaliatory') harassment.

Disenfranchisement, further, of affected citizens.

Officers allowed property to be stolen in their presence (gold paint, RayBans, Cole Haan, Red Nosed Pittbull [gift from Navajo for decon work], JBL Speaker, etc..).

Officers proceeded to commit property theft for themselves (50" QLED TV, Smith & Wesson Knife).

Officers damaged property, broke a Motorola XT2041DL and safety device (seat belt) on Touareg.
