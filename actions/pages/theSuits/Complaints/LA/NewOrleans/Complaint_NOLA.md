## Harassment
I took a picture in Navajo Nation ![NavajoCOVIDpicOfPic](/storage/emulated/0/TextNow/TextNow Images/image-2020-09-10-00-18-10.jpg) and printed it, from donations, to create a fundraiser.
Brad & Joe were speaking loudly about Phase ll vs lll and badly about the Mayor's decision; they were not profiting as before.
I took the picture and showed Brad, saying "this is why"; when I turned to show Joe he turned to not look saying he didn't want to see. I said "stay ignorant and keep talking shit" Joe
 ![Joe](/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera/VID_20200911_125304393_exported_7881_1603575713333~2.jpg) took offense and came, aggressively, towards me across the street.
