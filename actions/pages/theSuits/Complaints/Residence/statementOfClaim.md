2018: I, Nicholas D'Artagnan Dumas, was asked to lie, at multiple DMV's and Banks, about my residence address while being 'shelterless' with no, permitted, physical residence address; barring the ability to: receive private mail, open a bank account / safety deposit box, file for unemployment, receive stimulus, or register properly with the FEC.
