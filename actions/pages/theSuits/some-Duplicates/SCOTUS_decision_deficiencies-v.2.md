# SCOTUS Electoral College Decision

The decision invalidates the central role of the Electoral College. 
The Electors chuse [sic] the President; and, the systems faith is in knowing this whole's discretionary character; predicated upon their nomination and election to position.

The state legislature to mandate a Popular Vote to take all minifies/minimizes the core to merely a 'point system;' whereby no Electors are needed.

## The meeting of the Electors to sign on their, final, decisions.

Thus this system's  entire reliance is upon representation; at its foundation is the formation of a select set of individuals; with, which whom the power lay to establish the grounds of each governance cycle, through further selections of judicial officials. The very nature of the system is through indirect  powers; giving authorative responsibility to those entrusted. This design had [in part] the intention of slowing the public sway to some momentary swing of position; generating a stable system.

# PLEDGE LAWS

The idea of appointing them in the first place establishes contrary grounds than is argued in the [19 465_i425](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-465_i425.pdf) opening statements. Rather than simply assigning a "points system" to the states; there *is* the layer of Elector discretionary power to cast their vote.

As such, this systems fundamental design is around the separation of powers; this includes the people from the government; through the filters of representatives.

To bind a contract to a vote is abhorrent.

Thus this exemplifies the public interest in maintaining a just system through the chusing of the representing individuals. Laying the burden of knowing the characters of those who set the tone of the nation.

Citing Justice Jackson
> "no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text – that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices."

The history of recent debates around this seem to adjust words weightings; changing the context of them to a slanted perspective; with continued eschewing of the premise in the original document.

**Firstly** with the decisions set forth and further by the adherence to without requestioning of the faulty decision <!--what's this called again?-->Justice Jackson spoke out on.

> The next clause (but don’t get attached: it will soon be su-
perseded) set out the procedures the electors were to follow 
in casting their votes. In brief, each member of the College 
would cast votes for two candidates in the presidential field. 
The candidate with the greatest number of votes, assuming
he had a majority, would become President. The runner-up 
would become Vice President. If no one had a majority, the 
House of Representatives would take over and decide the 
winner.

> That plan failed to anticipate the rise of political parties,
and soon proved unworkable. The Nation’s first contested 
presidential election occurred in 1796, after George Wash-
ington’s retirement. John Adams came in first among the
candidates, and Thomas Jefferson second. That meant the 
leaders of the era’s two warring political parties—the Fed-
eralists and the Republicans—became President and Vice
President respectively. (One might think of this as fodder
for a new season of Veep.) Four years later, a different prob-
lem arose. Jefferson and Aaron Burr ran that year as a Re-
publican Party ticket, with the former meant to be Presi-
dent and the latter meant to be Vice. For that plan to
succeed, Jefferson had to come in first and Burr just behind
him. Instead, Jefferson came in first and Burr . . . did too. 
Every elector who voted for Jefferson also voted for Burr, 
producing a tie. That threw the election into the House of 
Representatives, which took no fewer than 36 ballots to
elect Jefferson. (Alexander Hamilton secured his place on
the Broadway stage—but possibly in the cemetery too—by
lobbying Federalists in the House to tip the election to Jef-
ferson, whom he loathed but viewed as less of an existential 
threat to the Republic.) By then, everyone had had enough
of the Electoral College’s original voting rules.

<!--Who is "everyone"?-->

<!-- Constitutional Power of establishing a political party -->

What is the problem with opposing political parties representing Presidential and Vice- offices? How is this "unworkable"? Is it not stated in the constitution that it is decided by the House'o'Rep's?

Contrary to the existing status quo; the premise that the Electoral College candidate selection may be, prima faci, the most in important selection process. Where, the decisions regarding the 12th Addendum and selecting Candidates for the Electoral College predicated upon the popular presidential candidate

Cannot override the fundamental intent of the process to begin with.

<!--These 'majikal' words of the court are paradigmical; soforth, setting a vision for the people of the United States; and, the world, as a, pace and trend setting, powerhouse.
The initial standing reductions to the system may be stood upon as 'long standing' (a priori) style inputs to current legal briefs; however, this does not mean the perspectives used for the foundation were the proper ones.

[Grooks - Majority/Minority](#todo +todo -cite)

This SCOTUS playing with the structured mechanic design of the system in a way which erodes the division of powers is a dangerous game; and, maybe something else should be thought out. For instance; reinforcing the decision to elect a quora; in doing which, may find a more well suited set of perspectives enjoined from our society.
