# Statement of Claim

## [Residence](..\..\Residence\resSoC.md)
The following institutions failed to provide services based upon, what appears to be, a Patriot Act stipulation for a Physical Residence Address:
Federal Elections Commission, FinCEN (Banner Bank, Mechanics Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America), USPS (PostNet, UPS), DMV, IRS, EDD, Blood Bank, +others

2018: I, Nicholas D'Artagnan Dumas, was asked to lie, at multiple DMV's and Banks, about my residence address while being 'shelterless' with no, permitted, physical residence address; barring the ability to: receive private mail, open a bank account / safety deposit box, file for unemployment, receive stimulus, or register properly with the FEC.

## Harassment
I took a picture in Navajo Nation ![NavajoCOVIDpicOfPic](/storage/emulated/0/TextNow/TextNow Images/image-2020-09-10-00-18-10.jpg) and printed it, from donations, to create a fundraiser.
Brad & Joe were speaking loudly about Phase ll vs lll and badly about the Mayor's decision; they were not profiting as before.
I took the picture and showed Brad, saying "this is why"; when I turned to show Joe he turned to not look saying he didn't want to see. I said "stay ignorant and keep talking shit" Joe
 ![Joe](/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera/VID_20200911_125304393_exported_7881_1603575713333~2.jpg) took offense and came, aggressively, towards me across the street.
