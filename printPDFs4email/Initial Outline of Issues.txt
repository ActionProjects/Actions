## Residence - ANIMUS MANENDI. The intention of remaining.

2018: I, Nicholas D'Artagnan Dumas, was asked to lie, at multiple DMV's and Banks, about my residence address while being 'shelterless' with no, permitted, physical residence address; barring the ability to: receive private mail, open a bank account / safety deposit box, file for unemployment, receive stimulus, or register, timely and properly, with the FEC.

Traveling individuals, while residents, without specific residential street addresses are barred from participating in the elections due to inadequate implementations.

>      RESIDENCE. The place of one's domicil. (q.v.) There is a difference between a man's residence and his domicil. He may have his domicil in Philadelphia, and still he may have a residence in New York; for although a man can have but one domicil, he may have several residences. A residence is generally transient in its nature, it becomes a domicil when it is taken up animo manendi. Roberts; Ecc. R. 75.

>     2. Residence is prima facie evidence of national character, but this may at all times be explained. When it is for a special purpose and transient in its nature, it does not destroy the national character.
